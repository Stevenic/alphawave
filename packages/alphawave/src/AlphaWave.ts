/**
 * AlphaWave class that's used to complete prompts.
 * @remarks
 * Each wave, at a minimum needs to be configured with a `client`, `prompt`, and `prompt_options`.
 *
 * Configuring the wave to use a `validator` is optional but recommended. The primary benefit to
 * using AlphaWave is it's response validation and automatic response repair features. The
 * validator acts as guard and guarantees that you never get an malformed response back from the
 * model. At least not without it being flagged as an `invalid_response`.
 *
 * Using the `JSONResponseValidator`, for example, guarantees that you only ever get a valid
 * object back from `completePrompt()`. In fact, you'll get back a fully parsed object and any
 * additional response text from the model will be dropped. If you give the `JSONResponseValidator`
 * a JSON Schema, you will get back a strongly typed and validated instance of an object in
 * the returned `response.message.content`.
 *
 * When a validator detects a bad response from the model, it gives the model "feedback" as to the
 * problem it detected with its response and more importantly an instruction that tells the model
 * how it should repair the problem. This puts the wave into a special repair mode where it first
 * forks the memory for the conversation and then has a side conversation with the model in an
 * effort to get it to repair its response. By forking the conversation, this isolates the bad
 * response and prevents it from contaminating the main conversation history. If the response can
 * be repaired, the wave will un-fork the memory and use the repaired response in place of the
 * original bad response. To the model it's as if it never made a mistake which is important for
 * future turns with the model. If the response can't be repaired, a response status of
 * `invalid_response` will be returned.
 *
 * When using a well designed validator, like the `JSONResponseValidator`, the wave can typically
 * repair a bad response in a single additional model call. Sometimes it takes a couple of calls
 * to effect a repair and occasionally it won't be able to repair it at all. If your prompt is
 * well designed and you only occasionally see failed repair attempts, I'd recommend just calling
 * the wave a second time. Given the stochastic nature of these models, there's a decent chance
 * it won't make the same mistake on the second call. A well designed prompt coupled with a well
 * designed validator should get the reliability of calling these models somewhere close to 99%
 * reliable.
 *
 * This "feedback" technique works with all the GPT-3 generation of models and I've tested it with
 * `text-davinci-003`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, and `gpt-4`. There's a good chance it will work with other
 * open source models like `LLaMA` and Googles `Bard` but I have yet to test it with those models.
